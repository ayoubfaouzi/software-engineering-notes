# Chapter 5. Replication

- Replication means keeping a **copy** of the same data on **multiple machines** that are connected via a network. 
  - To keep data **geographically close** to your users (and thus reduce latency)
  - Increase **availability**.
  - To scale out the number of machines that can serve read queries (and thus increase **read throughput**).
- If the data that you‚Äôre replicating **does not change** over time, then replication is easy ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:
  - You just need to copy the data to every node once, and you‚Äôre done. 
  - All of the **difficulty** in replication lies in handling **changes** to replicated data, and that‚Äôs what this chapter is about.

## Leaders and Followers

- Each node that stores a copy of the database is called a **replica**.
- How do we ensure that all the data ends up on all the replicas ‚ùì
- The most common solution for this is called **leader-based replication** (also known as **active/passive** or **master‚Äìslave** replication). It works as follows:
  1. One of the replicas is designated the **leader** (also known as **master** or **primary**). When clients want to write to the database, they must send their requests to the leader, which first writes the new data to its local storage.
  2. The other replicas are known as **followers** (read **replicas**, **slaves**, **secondaries**, or **hot standbys**). Whenever the leader writes new data to its local storage, it also sends the data change to all of its followers as part of a **replication log** or **change stream**. Each follower takes the log from the leader and updates its local copy of the data‚Äêbase accordingly, by applying all writes in the same order as they were processed on the leader.
  3. When a client wants to read from the database, it can query either the leader or any of the followers. However, writes are only accepted on the leader (the followers are read-only from the client‚Äôs point of view).

### Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Replication

- In the example of Figure 5-2, the replication to *follower 1* is **synchronous**: the leader waits until follower 1 has **confirmed** that it received the **write** before reporting success to the user, and before making the write visible to other clients. The replication to *follower 2* is **asynchronous**: the leader sends the message, but doesn‚Äôt wait for a response from the follower.

- Normally, replication is **quite fast**: most database systems apply changes to followers in **less than a second**.
- However, there is no guarantee of how long it might take ü§ì. There are circumstances when followers might fall behind the leader by several minutes or more, for example:
  - If a follower is recovering from a **failure**,
  - If the system is operating near **maximum capacity**,
  - or if there are **network problems** between the nodes.
- The üëç of synchronous replication is that the follower is **guaranteed** to have an **up-to-date** copy of the data that is consistent with the leader. If the leader suddenly fails, we can be sure that the data is still available on the follower.
- The üëé is that if the synchronous follower **doesn‚Äôt respond** (because it has **crashed**, or there is a **network fault**, or for any other reason), the write cannot be processed üë®‚Äçüíª. The leader must block all writes and wait until the synchronous replica is available again.
- ‚û°Ô∏è This configuration is sometimes also called **semi-synchronous**.
- **Asynchronous** leader-based replication allows the leader to confirm writes without waiting for followers.
  - This improves **availability** and **throughput** (especially with many or geographically distant replicas) but **weakens** **durability** if the leader fails before replication, recent writes may be lost. Despite this risk, it‚Äôs commonly used in practice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

### Setting Up New Followers

- Conceptually, the process looks like this:
  - Take a **consistent snapshot** of the leader‚Äôs database at some point in time ‚Äî if possible, **without** taking a **lock** on the entire database.
  - Copy the snapshot to the new follower node.
  -The follower connects to the leader and requests all the data changes that have happened since the snapshot was taken. This requires that the snapshot is associated with an exact position in the **leader‚Äôs replication log**. That position has various names: for example, `PostgreSQL` calls it the **log sequence number**, and MySQL calls it the **binlog coordinates**.
   -When the follower has processed the backlog of data changes since the snapshot, we say it has caught up. It can now continue to process data changes from the leader as they happen.

### Handling Node Outages

- When a follower fails or is disconnected, it uses its **local log** to identify the **last processed transaction**. Upon recovery, it reconnects to the leader, requests the missing changes, applies them, and then resumes normal replication.
- Leader failure requires **failover**, where a follower is **promoted** to **leader**, clients redirect writes, and other replicas follow the new leader. Failover may be **manual** or **automatic**, involving:
  - (1) detecting leader failure (often via **timeouts**),
  - (2) electing/choosing the most up-to-date replica as new leader (a **consensus** problem), and
  - (3) reconfiguring the system so **clients** and nodes follow the **new leader** while ensuring the **old leader steps down** if it returns.
- Failover is fraught with things that can go wrong:
  - Failover can cause **data loss** or **conflicts** if replication is **asynchronous**: the new leader may lack some of the old leader‚Äôs writes, and if the old leader rejoins, its unreplicated writes are usually **discarded** ‚Äî potentially breaking **durability** guarantees ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
  - **Split brain** occurs when two nodes both think they are leader, risking data loss or corruption if both accept writes. To prevent this, systems may **shut down** one leader ‚Äî but poor design can cause both to shut down ü§ì.
  - Choosing the leader **timeout** is a **trade-off**: long timeouts delay recovery after failure, but short ones risk unnecessary failovers due to load spikes or network glitches, which can worsen problems.

### Implementation of Replication Logs

#### Statement-based replication

Statement-based replication logs and **forwards** executed **SQL statements** (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) to followers, but it suffers from problems with **non-deterministic** functions (such as `NOW()` or `RAND()`), **auto-incrementing** values, **ordering** of **concurrent** transactions, and side effects from **triggers** or **procedures**. Workarounds exist, but due to many edge cases, more reliable replication methods are generally preferred.

#### Write-ahead log (WAL) shipping

WAL shipping replicates data by sending the leader‚Äôs **append-only** log of low-level storage changes to followers, which then rebuild the same data structures. It‚Äôs used in systems like `PostgreSQL` and `Oracle`. While effective, it tightly couples replication to the storage engine, making **cross-version** replication difficult. This complicates **upgrades**, often requiring downtime since followers usually can‚Äôt run **newer versions** than the **leader**.

#### Logical (row-based) log replication

Logical logs **decouple** replication from **storage engine** internals by recording changes at the row level (inserts, deletes, updates) rather than **low-level disk operations** ü§î. This approach, used in `MySQL‚Äôs` row-based `binlog`, enables easier **backward compatibility**, supports running different versions or storage engines across leader and followers, and is more accessible for external applications (e.g., data warehouses, custom indexes). This technique is known as **change data capture**.

#### Trigger-based replication

Replication is usually handled by the database itself, but in cases needing more **flexibility** ‚Äî like **selective replication**, **cross-database** replication, or **conflict resolution** ‚Äî it can be moved to the **application** layer. Tools like `Oracle GoldenGate` read database logs, while triggers and stored procedures let custom code capture and replicate changes. Although trigger-based replication is **slower** and more **error-prone** than built-in methods, it remains valuable for its flexibility.
