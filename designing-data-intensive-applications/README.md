# Designing Data Intensive Applications

notes taken from reading the _Designing Data Intensive Applications_ book by Martin Kleppmann.

## Part II

- There are various reasons why you might want to distribute a database across multiple machines:
  - Scalability
  - Fault Taulerance/High Availability
  - Latency
- If all you need is to scale to **higher load**, the simplest approach is to buy a more powerful machine ‚û°Ô∏è scale vertically.
  - In this kind of **shared-memory architecture**, all the components can be treated as a single machine.
  - The problem with a shared-memory approach is that the cost grows faster than **linearly**: a machine with twice as many CPUs, twice as much RAM, and twice as much disk capacity as another typically costs significantly more than twice as much ü§∑.
  - Limited fault tolerance (hot-swappable components), limited to a **single geographic** location.
- Another approach is the **shared-disk architecture**, the problem is you can have **contention** and the overhead of **locking** limit the scalability of the shared-disk approach.
- By contrast, **shared-nothing architectures** (sometimes called **horizontal scaling** or scaling out)
  - Coordination between nodes is done at the software level, using a conventional network.
  - Part II focus on shared-nothing architectures not because they are necessarily the best choice for every use case, but rather because they require the most caution from you, the application developer.

## Part III

- While earlier parts of the book focused on how a single distributed database works, real-world applications often use **multiple data systems** ‚Äî such as databases, indexes, caches, and analytics tools ‚Äî each optimized for different needs. The challenge then becomes how to **integrate** these diverse systems into one coherent architecture.
- It introduces two key categories of data systems:
  - **Systems of Record** (Source of Truth) ‚Äì These hold the **authoritative** version of data. New information is written here first, and if discrepancies occur, this system is always considered correct. The data is typically normalized and non-redundant.
  - **Derived Data Systems** ‚Äì These contain data **transformed** or processed from **another source**. They are redundant but useful, enabling faster queries or alternative views of the data (e.g., caches, indexes, materialized views, recommendation summaries). Derived data can always be recreated from the original source.
- The distinction between these two types helps clarify the dataflow within an application ‚Äî defining **what depends on what** and how data moves through the system. Most databases can serve either role; what matters is how they‚Äôre used in the architecture.
- In essence, understanding and explicitly separating systems of record from derived data systems brings **clarity**, **structure**, and **reliability** to complex data architectures.
